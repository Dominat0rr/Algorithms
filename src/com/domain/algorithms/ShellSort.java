/**
 * ShellSort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort.
 * In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead.
 * When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved.
 * The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far items.
 * In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h.
 * We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1.
 * An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
